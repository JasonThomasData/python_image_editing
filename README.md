## Image editing in Python

This project started with two ideas for an image effect that I haven't seen yet. I want to take an image, split it into a grid of pixels and replace grid cells with different objects.

Now, this is simply a place where I will keep image editing scripts so that they can share code etc.

### Installing

I'll always recommend using a [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). 

The best way to install the dependencies for this program is to run
	
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Use examples

[Mosaic](docs/mosaic.md)

[Simplify colours](docs/simplify_colours.md)
